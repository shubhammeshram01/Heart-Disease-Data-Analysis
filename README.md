# Heart-Disease-Data-Analysis

## Dataset Description :
This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them.

## Python libraries used to analyze :
* Pandas
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib

## Column Attribute Information :
1. age
2. sex
3. chest pain type (4 values)
 * Value 0 : typical angina
 * Value 1 : atypical angina
 * Value 2 : non-anginal pain
 * Value 3 : asymptomatic
4. trestbps : resting blood pressure
5. chol : serum cholesterol in mg/dl
6. fbs : fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
7. restecg : resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
 * Value 0 : Normal
 * Value 1 : Having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
 * Value 2 : Showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes's criteria
8. thalach : maximum heart rate achieved
9. exang : exercise-induced angina(1 = yes , 0 = No )
10. oldpeak : ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11. slope : the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
 * Value 1 : upsloping
 * Value 2 : flat
 * Value 3 : downsloping
12. ca : number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
13. thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversible defect
14. target : 0 = less chance of heart attack, 1 = more chances of heart attack

The names and social security numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database, and replaced with dummy values

## Analyze the following questions :

1) How many people have heart disease and how many don't have it?
2) Find the count of male and female
3) Gender distribution according to the Target variable
4) Age distribution in the dataset
5) Check chest pain type and plot it
6) Check chest pain distribution as per the target variable and visualize it
7) Show fasting blood sugar distribution according to the target variable and plot the chart
8) Check resting blood pressure distribution and visualize it
9) Compare resting blood pressure as per sex column 
10) Check the distribution of Serum Cholesterol and visualize it
