# Heart-Disease-Data-Analysis

## Dataset Description :
This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them.

## Python libraries used to analyze :
* Pandas
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib

## Column Attribute Information :

1. age
2. sex
3. chest pain type (4 values)
 * Value 0 : typical angina
 * Value 1 : atypical angina
 * Value 2 : non-anginal pain
 * Value 3 : asymptomatic
4. trestbps : resting blood pressure
5. chol : serum cholesterol in mg/dl
6. fbs : fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
7. restecg : resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
 * Value 0 : Normal
 * Value 1 : Having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
 * Value 2 : Showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes's criteria
8. thalach : maximum heart rate achieved
9. exang : exercise-induced angina(1 = yes , 0 = No )
10. oldpeak : ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11. slope : the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
 * Value 1 : upsloping
 * Value 2 : flat
 * Value 3 : downsloping
12. ca : number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
13. thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversible defect
14. target : 0 = less chance of heart attack, 1 = more chances of heart attack

The names and social security numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database, and replaced with dummy values
